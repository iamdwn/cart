## Technologies Used

**JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: JSP is a technology used to create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. It allows embedding Java code into HTML pages by using special tags, making it easier to write and maintain dynamic web content. JSP pages are compiled into servlets by the web container before being executed.

**Servlets**: Servlets are Java classes that dynamically process and respond to requests from web clients, such as web browsers. They run on the server side and handle HTTP requests and responses. Servlets can generate dynamic content, interact with databases, perform authentication, and more.
